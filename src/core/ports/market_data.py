"""
core.domain.ports.market_data
-----------------------------
Market data port interface. Concrete adapters (e.g., Alpaca, Tradier) must
implement this protocol to provide historical bars.

Errors:
    Adapters should surface transport/auth/permission failures by raising
    `MarketDataError`. Implementations should normalize outputs to domain
    types (`Bar`) before returning.
"""

###
#EDITS
# 10/13/2025: Created basic overarching interface with get_bars and stream_protocols
# 10/13/2025: Added docstrean and cleaned for deployment. Removed stream_protocols as it will not be implemented for a long time
